Hamming code was one of the prevalently used Error Detection Algorithym, but is not used nowadays because of availibility of better and more accurate algorithyms.

This is avery basic implementation of Hamming Code where a string is accepted and Hamming Code for each charater is generated.

Example Usage for 'Hello':
```
'H' (ASCII 72, Binary 01001000) -> Hamming code: 000110011000 /
'e' (ASCII 101, Binary 01100101) -> Hamming code: 100111000101
'l' (ASCII 108, Binary 01101100) -> Hamming code: 000011001100
'l' (ASCII 108, Binary 01101100) -> Hamming code: 000011001100
'o' (ASCII 111, Binary 01101111) -> Hamming code: 110111001111
```
